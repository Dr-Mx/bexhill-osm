	<h3>Railways (1846+)</h3>
	<h3 class="maplink" title="Display overlay" onclick="window.parent.tour('westBranch');">Bexhill West Branch Line</h3>
	Running from 1902 to 1964 this railway was a branch of the Hastings Line. It ran from Crowhurst to the bottom of what is now known as the Beeching Road Industrial Estate.
	The largest structure on the line was the Combe Haven Viaduct (aka Crowhurst Viaduct). It took two years and nine million bricks to build the seventeen arches over the marshland. It was destroyed in 1969 by controlled demolition.<br/>

	<h3 class="maplink sm" title="Show on map" onclick="window.parent.tourFocus('westBranch', 'n318219478');">Bexhill West Station</h3>
	The terminating point for the West Branch Line, hence the named location of Terminus Road. The main building surives, now as an antiques gallery and pub. Across the road where Belmont apartments are today was once the bus depot.

	<h3 class="maplink sm" title="Show on map" onclick="window.parent.tourFocus('westBranch', 'n6528018966');">Sidley Station</h3>
	Part of the West Branch Line, Sidley Station was located where Elva Way and the BP Service Station stands today.
	<p>Two hotels were built to accommodate visitors; The Sussex Hotel (today known as Sussex House), and the Pelham Hotel (now The Pelham).</p>

	<h3 class="maplink" title="Show on map" onclick="window.parent.tour('bexhillStation');">Bexhill Railway Station</h3>
	There have been three separate stations here since 1846; one was located where Sainsbury's carpark is now, the second was on Devonshire Square around 1891, and in 1902 they amalgamated to form the station we now have on Sea Road.<sup>1</sup>
	<p>The long platforms were a benefit to the huge amount of visitors and private schools that operated in the 1900's. There would be so many travelling at the weekends, it would often be preferable to catch the early morning milk train down from London.</p>
	In 2008 the station went under heavy restoration and is now a Grade II listed building.

	<h3 class="maplink" title="Show on map" onclick="window.parent.tour('glynegapStation');">Glyne Gap Halt Railway Station</h3>
	Built in 1905 between stations Bexhill and Hastings, closed ten years later due to competition from the electric tramway. Currently there is a study to see if it is viable to have the station reinstated.
