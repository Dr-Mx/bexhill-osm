	<h3>Northeye Prison Site (1940+)</h3>
	<h3>Royal Air Force (1940-1964)</h3>
	This site was originally used during the Second World War by the RAF as a Mobile Radio Unit, reserved if Chain Home radar station located at Pevensey became damaged by the enemy.<sup>1</sup>
	<p>It wasn't until after the war in 1958, it became the RAF Wartling Domestic Site which comprised of hutted accommodation and a Married Quarters estate (which still exists as a residential area today).</p>
	Various tunnels and underground bunkers are reportedly still within the site, and some Air Ministry (AM) boundary stones can be found around the fencing.

	Following the closure of the RAF Wartling radar station in 1964, the site became HMP Northeye - a Category C prison which opened in January 1969. Many of the original RAF huts were used as prison buildings, although more were added in the 1970's.

	On the evening of the 30th April 1986, a number of the 447 inmates began to set fire to buildings after an altercation with the guards.<sup>2</sup> With staff outnumbered due to a recent overtime ban and unable to call for backup as the radio room had become damaged, Governor Danny Ozanne made the decision to completely withdraw.
	<p>The kitchen, library, education room and hospital were all set ablaze - together with various workshops, billets and stores. The flames were said to be visible up to 5 miles away.</p>
	<p>It took until 8am the next day for officers to regain control of the prison, with 40% of the buildings now completely destroyed. Police said 12 inmates were believed to have escaped during the violence; the rest had to be evacuated to Drill Hall on Down Road before they were moved on to various other prisons.</p>
	HMP Northeye reopened after the riot with a new internal security fence, upgraded lighting and additional staff for a smaller number of 250 inmates. The prison ultimately closed in October 1992. Some Home Office Prison Department (HOPD) boundary stones can still be found around the perimeter.

	<h3>United Arab Emirates (1993-2010)</h3>
	After the closure of the prison, the UAE refurbished the camp and used it as a technical training project. It aimed to prepare UAE students in colleges across the UK for a technical future in the UAE Armed Forces.

	Northeye was left disused since the UAE project ended, despite being available for private sale. In March 2023 the Home Office announced the site was to be converted into a holding centre for 1,400 immigrants crossing the English Channel.<sup>3</sup> This purpose has now been deemed unsuitable and the site is likely to be sold to housing developers.
