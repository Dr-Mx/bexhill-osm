	<h3>Royal Air Force (1940-1964)</h3>
	This site was originally used during the Second World War by the RAF as a Mobile Radio Unit, reserved if Chain Home radar station located at Pevensey became damaged by the enemy.<sup>1</sup>
	<p>It wasn't until after the war in 1958, it became the RAF Wartling Domestic Site which comprised of hutted accommodation and a Married Quarters estate (which still exists as a residential area today).</p>
	Various tunnels and underground bunkers are reportedly still within the site, and some AM (Air Ministry) boundary stones can be found around the fencing.
	<h3>HMP Northeye (1969-1992)</h3>
	Following the closure of the RAF Wartling radar station in 1964, the site became HMP Northeye - a Category C prison which opened in January 1969. Many of the original RAF huts were used as prison buildings, although more were added in the 1970's.

	On the evening of the 30th April 1986, 60 of the 450 inmates began to set fire to buildings after an altercation with the guards.<sup>2</sup> With many of the huts being roofed with corrugated asbestos they were vulnerable to intense heat, causing the fires to intensify and spread quickly.
	<p>Police said 12 inmates were believed to have escaped during the violence, the rest had to be evacuated to Drill Hall on Down Road before they were moved on to various other prisons the next day. By the end of the night 40% the buildings had been completely destroyed.</p>
	The prison reopened after the riots, but for a smaller number of inmates until 1992. Some HOPD (Home Office Prison Department) boundary stones can still be found around site.

	<h3>United Arab Emirates (1993-2010)</h3>
	After the closure of the prison, the UAE refurbished the camp and used it as a technical training project. Aimed to prepare a younger generation of UAE nationals for a techinical future in the UAE Armed Forces.
	<h3>Unknown Future</h3>
	Northeye has been left disused since the UAE project ended, and the land is currently up for private sale. The attached recreation ground is on Rother Council's Development and Site Allocations Plan (DaSA)<sup>3</sup>.
