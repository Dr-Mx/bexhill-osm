	Initially Bexhill was identified as a safe place at the outbreak of the Second World War and received over 700 evacuated children from London.  This changed in 1940 when frequent air-raids began along the south coast.
	<p>
	Bexhill's beaches were closed off and surrounded by barbed wire, mines and concrete anti-tank cubes (aka dragon's teeth, some of which can be found at low tide today).  Light anti-aircraft guns supported by armoured vehicles were placed around town and later, heavy anti-aircraft guns were installed along the promenade.

	There were 51 air-raids in total, dropping 328 explosive bombs and over 1,000 incendiary bombs. 81 buildings were destroyed, 217 seriously damaged and 4,324 lightly damaged. 25 deaths were recorded, including 1 soldier.<sup>[<a onclick="window.parent.tour('source');">13</a>]</sup>
	<p>
	For almost 80 days Bexhill lay in the 'bomb alley' flight path to London, in one 24 hour period 48 doodlebugs were tracked overhead.
