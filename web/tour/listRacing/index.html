	Fathered by the 8th Earl De La Warr and with assistance from the RAC, Britain's first motorcar race was held on Monday, 19th May 1902. The track of 1km (on what was then Bexhill's cycle boulevard) ran from Galley Hill to Sackville Lawns.
	<p>Over 200 international drivers and vehicles competed throughout the day in time-trials to a 30,000 crowd.<sup>1</sup></p>

	Two further races were held on 3rd August 1904 and 2nd August 1907.

	The star of the 1902 show was Leon Serpollet's steam-powered 'Gardner-Serpollet Oeuf de Pacques' (aka The Easter Egg), which won the race at a top speed of almost 55mph along the promenade.
	<p>Being designer, manufacturer and driver, Frenchman Leon Serpollet used this car a month earlier to break the land-speed record at 75mph in Nice, France.</p>
	A steel sculpture of the Easter Egg can be found on Sackville Lawns on East Parade, and a full-size replica can be viewed in the Motoring Gallery at Bexhill Museum.
