	Surveying points (or benchmarks) were made by Ordnance Survey to record the height above mean sea level (MSL) in the days before GPS. If the exact height of one point is known, the exact height of the next can be found by measuring the difference in heights, through a process of spirit levelling.
	<p>Hidden in plain sight on buildings or other semi-permanent features there are still around 500,000 benchmarks in the UK even though they have not been maintained since the 1970-80's.<sup>1</sup></p>
	<p>By clicking on the map-icon above you can find many of the survey points scattered throughout Bexhill today. These numbers are set to reduce due to property development, road widening, erosion and so on.</p>
	If you own property with a benchmark please look after it, after all - many historic land surveyors, builders, engineers and map makers would have once used them.
	<h3>Types</h3>
	<b>Triangulation Stations</b> (trig point): Located on hilltops in the form of pillars with a metal plate for mounting a theodolite (a precision instrument for measuring angles in the horizontal and vertical planes).

	<b>Flush Brackets</b>: Metal plates about 9cm wide and 17.5cm long. Each bracket has a unique reference number. They are most commonly found on Triangulation Stations or on important civic buildings.
	<p><img alt="Flush Bracket" src="bm-bracket.jpg"><div class="comment">Bracket at St. Mark's Church Hall, Little Common.</div></p>
	<b>Cut Benchmarks</b> (crows' feet): The most common form of survey mark, a horizontal bar cut into a wall or brickwork and are found just about anywhere. A broad arrow is cut immediately below the centre of the horizontal bar.
	<p><img alt="Cut Benchmark" src="bm-cbenchmark.jpg"><div class="comment">Cut on a wall at the junction of Upper Sea Road and Buckhurst Road.</div></p>
	<b>Rivet / Pivot Benchmarks</b>: Similar to Cut Benchmarks, but the horizontal bar is replaced or contains a bolt / hole.
