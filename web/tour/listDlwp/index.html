	Commissioned by 9th Earl De La Warr to replace the elitist Victorian 'winter garden', the De La Warr Pavilion was designed by architects Erich Mendelsohn (German) and Serge Chermayeff (Russian).
	<p>The original design included a larger colonnade to the west, a swimming pool and pier - but these were later abandoned due to costs.<sup>1</sup></p>

	The Pavilion was completed in eleven and a half months at a public cost of £70,000 (£4.5m in today's money).
	<p>Britain's first major welded-steel framed and Modernist building was opened on the 12th December 1935 by the Duke and Duchess of York to a crowd of thousands.</p>

	During the second world war it was requisitioned by the Ministry of Defence and sustained minor damage from a bomb falling on the adjacent Metropole Hotel.
	<p>Over the years the steelwork proved vulnerable to the seaside climate and with lacking public funds, the Pavilion fell into disrepair by the early 1980's.<sup>2</sup></p>
	<p>In 1989 The De La Warr Pavilion Charitable Trust was formed to restore and redevelop the building. Securing a £6m grant through the Arts Council and Heritage Lottery, the regenerated Pavillion reopened in 2005.</p>
	<p>Today the De La Warr stands as an iconic Grade I listed building. It is the cultural centre for contemporary art in Bexhill, bringing in 400,000 visitors a year.</p>
