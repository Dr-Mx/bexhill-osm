	Bexhill's oldest clock, unveiled on 20th June 1887 to mark Queen Victoria’s Golden Jubilee. On 20th June 1908 a building fire destroyed the clock's mechanism, 
	thankfully the clock’s casing was not too badly damaged and it was was restored to its original state on King Edward VII’s birthday, 9th November 1908.<br>
	Both the original and replacement mechanism was provided by a local clockmaker, Mr Shindler.
