Charters Towers School amalgamated with Ancaster House (school) in 1985. Chartres is also a town 50 miles south-west of Paris which is noted for its medieval cathedral.

		<desc>Origin of this name remains uncertain. Built on the former Fairmount Estate, which was bordered by the present-day Hastings Road, Elmstead Road, Dorset Road and King Offa Way. In the 1886 street directory, Fairmount and Elmstead were both large detached houses on St Johns Road. Elmstead is still there in March 2013 but Fairmount was demolished at an unknown date. Although Elmstead Road is close to Fairmount Road it is uncertain whether the two properties in St Johns Road had any influence on the choice of these two road names. Elmstead can mean a place by the elm-trees. Elmstead Heath, Elmstead Market and Elmstead Row are three villages close to, and to the east of, Colchester, Essex.

		<name>Larkhill</name>
		<date>1972</date>
		<desc>The origin of the name remains uncertain. R A Larkin and Bros Ltd were major developers and house builders in Bexhill between 1924 to 1988. They developed this road and as the houses are built along a hillside then maybe this is a made-up name combining Larkin and hill. Alternatively, larks are small to medium sized perching birds of the family Alaudidae, noted for their extravagant songs. Maybe in the past they were a common sight in this hilly area. Finally, Larkhill is a long-established garrison town on Salisbury Plain near Durrington, Wiltshire, but any possible link to Bexhill has not yet been established.

		<desc>Little Common takes its name from a triangular common including, and slightly larger than, the area between Green Lane and Lower Peartree Lane; at its apex is the Picknill Stream and at its base the present-day A259. Originally this was the road leading from Bexhill Old Town to and from Little Common. The part from near White Hill Avenue to the Little Common roundabout was previously known as Church Hill (Road). The section around the present-day Denbigh Hotel and the former Hurchington estate was previously known as Whitehill as well as Whitehill Lane. The outline of the whole road can be seen on an Ordnance Survey map 1795 to 1825. Beaconsfield Terrace, built around 1880 and Congressbury Terrace, probably built a few years later, on either side of the present-day Chandler Road, feature as a street address in census and street directories of that time. The Down Arch (previously known as the South Eastern Railway bridge) which carried the railway branch line from Crowhurst to Bexhill over this road where it meets London Road was demolished in 1967.

Alternatively, it is the name of four districts or villages in England including one close to Ormskirk, Lancashire, which has a golf course. That golf course is about 5 miles south-east of the Royal Birkdale golf course, the inspiration for the Larkins choosing the name Birkdale for the road leading from Collington Avenue towards Little Common. Finally, primroses are herbaceous perennial garden and wild plants belonging to the genus Primula. (Roselands and Summer Hill Road are nearby).

		<name>Westcourt Drive</name>
		<date>road 1908; name 1925</date>
		<desc>The origin of the name remains uncertain. The road was developed at a similar time to Southcourt Avenue and maybe the two names are linked. However it is unclear what or where these two roads may be “south” and “west” of. The answer would be Collington Wood if the drive was called “Eastcourt Drive”. Originally Richmond Avenue ran from the cattle arch under the railway line, across Cooden Drive and then as far as its junction with Richmond Road. The section of present-day Westcourt Drive from the cattle arch to Collington Avenue was only a footpath until the early 1920s. Then during redevelopment the existing single-track cattle arch was enlarged to allow vehicles to pass under the line. This arch, as well as ones at Cooden Beach, Sackville Road and Glyne Gap, had been established to enable farmers north of the railway line to move their stock to summer grazing on the low-lying marshland to the south of the railway.
