	From around the 14th century mechanical clocks became popular in places where there were a large number of people working together. Regulating life in and around churches, monasteries, country houses to the later factories, barracks and transport stations.
	<p>Originally, clocks would have been set by a sundial meaning northern parts of the UK could be out as much as 30 minutes compared to the south. This wasn't a problem until faster travel came in the form of railways, thus Greenwich Mean Time was adopted as a national standard in 1880.</p>
	Today public clocks have declined in importance, replaced by watches and electronics. We're lucky to still have quite a number of them dotted around town, many with their own story. Curiously none of our 23 churches have any visible timepiece.

	<h3 class="maplink sm" title="Show on map" onclick="window.parent.tourFocus('publicClocks', 'n4660717764');">Jubilee Clock</h3>
	Bexhill's oldest clock, unveiled on 20th June 1887 to mark Queen Victoria’s Golden Jubilee. On 20th June 1908 a building fire destroyed the clock's mechanism, thankfully the clock’s casing was not too badly damaged and it was restored to its original state on King Edward VII’s birthday, 9th November 1908.
	<p>Both the original and replacement mechanism was provided by a local clockmaker, Mr Shindler.</p>

	The clock mechanism was made by Wright &amp; Sons, a local watch and clockmaker, now electric it was hand-wound until December 1999. Its clock faces are not original and attributed to Andrew Kemp and Norman Holmes.<sup>1</sup>
	<p>The tower itself was built to celebrate King Edward VII’s Coronation on 9th August 1902 but due to poor planning it was not completed until two years later.</p>
	<p>Once chiming every hour, some residents at Clock Tower Court (built in 1959) complained of the noise and the bell was removed and placed in Bexhill Museum.</p>
	<p>The colours we see today were chosen by the council in 1990, the imitation Bath stone tower was painted battleship grey prior to this from WW2.</p>
	In July 2004, a plaque as unveiled by Mayor Paul Lendon to finally put King Edward's name on the memorials south face. Specialist clockmaker Thwaits and Reed restored the clock in April 2007. A repaint, refurbishment of the weather vane, and new lights were installed in October 2015.

	The clock in the tower was erected in memory of Charles Anson who was a cousin of King George V. Anson was considered Bexhill hospital’s 'founding father' and his wife ceremonially started the clock in October 1934.
	<p>A smaller Synchronome, pendulum clock can be found inside the southern ward of the hospital - this would have been used to synchronise all the other clocks in the hospital.</p>

	Today an antiques house, this was once Bexhill West train station built in 1902.
	<p>Manufactured by famous clock-makers Gillett and Johnston of Croydon it still has its original weight driven mechanism. The names dozens of clock-winders throughout the years can be found inside its turret.</p>
	<p>Being in a state of disuse for many years a local charity, Bexhill Heritage, restored the mechanism and its four faces to full working order.</p>
	It was restarted by the Mayor on Sussex Day 2018 and is now wound once a week by volunteers.
