	<h3 class="maplink sm" title="Show on map" onclick="window.parent.tourFocus('lost', 'wshelt');">West Parade Shelters</h3>
	West Parade, 1899-1977.	Located opposite the Clock Tower, this once elegant Victorian structure was a functioning bandstand then a sole shelter from about 1920.
	<p>Both these shelters were demolished in 1977 due to lack of upkeep. Today on West Parade we have four controversial shelters built in 2011 by Duggan Morris Architects.</p>

	West Parade, 1897-1955. Architect Joseph Wall, opened in May 1900. 160 bedrooms, smoking-room, billiard-room, tennis courts and electric lifts.

	The only remains are a length of wall next to the De La Warr Pavilion stage entrance, and its 4 acres of private gardens - now the public Metropole Lawns.
