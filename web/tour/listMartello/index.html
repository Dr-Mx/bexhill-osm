	The last successful invasions of England were by William, Duke of Normandy in 1066 and William III, Prince of Orange in 1688. Since that time many were tempted to attack our shores, but none were taken as seriously as threats from the Emperor of France, Napoléon Bonaparte when he declared war in 1793.
	<p>After years of fighting across Europe, Napoléon turned his full attention to crossing the English Channel and amassed an army of over 200,000 troops at ports in Northern France and Belgium.</p>
	<p>These preparations were financed by France selling her North American territories to the United States in return for 50 million French francs. Ironically, the US had partly funded the purchase by with a loan from Baring Brothers, a British bank based in the City of London.<sup>1</sup></p>
	Britain was put on high alert and selected building sites along the south coast for Martello towers to counter the threat in 1804. Dover Castle had underground tunnels added, the Dover Western Heights were constructed, and the Royal Military Canal cut should Napoléon land on Romney Marsh.

	Bexhill's towers were built by John 'Yorky' Smith from Leeds under supervision from the Royal Engineers between 1805 and 1808. Built of bricks brought in barges from Rye, the sea-facing walls were 11ft, 6in and those facing land were 9ft, 6in thick. The towers were 40ft high with a bottom diameter of 40ft and top diameter of 30ft across. Each fortress was equipped with a 2.5 ton cannon mounted on a central pivot which enabled it to fire in any direction.<sup>2</sup>
	<p>Yorky became very wealthy from the whole venture and continued working in Hastings even after the war. He built the first house, 57 Marina, in the new town of St. Leonards and was first to be buried at Hastings Cemetery in 1856.<sup>3</sup></p>
	<p>Original estimates put the cost of each tower at £2,000, by completion this had reached over £3,000 (about £140,000 today).<sup>4</sup></p>
	<p>The towers had three levels and were only accessible through a removable ladder on the first floor in case of siege. The ground floor basement was used for ammunition and gunpowder accessed through a trap door, the first floor was the living quarters where up to 24 men and an officer shared three rooms, and the top floor was the gun platform accessed by a stairway.</p>
	<p>Manned by trained troops from the Royal Artillery, a 24 pound shot from the tower's cannon would reach about a mile out to sea. If a French vessel got close enough to the shore it would have been in range of 4 of these guns.</p>
	Napoléon's invasion never came to be. The Royal Navy maintained a close blockade of French bases and in the end, Napoleon's Empire was destroyed by land before he could build up his naval forces.

	After the Napoleonic War ended Martello towers were put to a number of uses - Coastal Blockade lookouts against smugglers; homes for retired soldiers; signalling stations; wireless technology experiments; military tests; demolished for masonry; and observation and firing platforms for artillery during WWII.
	<p>Bexhill's last reminder of this important part of history is tower No.55, now a privately owned Listed Building at Normans Bay. You can find more about each of our Martello's by clicking the title at the top of this article.</p>
