Two 68lb and two 32lb smooth-bore guns were being moved along the line from Bexhill to directly opposite the tower. During the unloading, Lieutenant Marshall lost his hand when it was accidentally crushed under a gun. He was quickly removed to Powell's Hotel (The Bell, Old Town).<br>Saturday, 10th November 1860. The experiments commenced with both shot and shell being fired from 1,030yd over four days. The Duke of Cambridge was in attendance with a huge crowd of spectators, at one point guns were fired over the public's heads to stop them scavenging the spent shells! In the end the bombardment had little effect on the tower, with only four shots penetrating the interior. The tower finally succumbed when the distance was reduced to 400yds.<br>Some of the bricks were used to make Kewhurst Coastguard Station (demolished 1920, now Westbourne Court).",

This time Government authorities tested their 70lb Armstrong and Whitworth Guns commanded by Lieutenant Robinson and 50 men of the Coastal Blockade. On the first day solid shot and blind shells were fired, which considerably damaged the wall, but seemed to have been pierced through in one place only - each shot only brought down a portion of brick at a time, slowly chipping away at the tower. On the second day live shells were fired knocking down the near side of the eight foot thick wall together with the centre pillar. Only the outer sea side of the tower remained and this was promptly destroyed on the third day."
