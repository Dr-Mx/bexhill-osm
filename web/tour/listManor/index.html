	<b>1250</b>: It is thought that the original timber framed building built around 1066 (called Bishops Palace) was damaged by a great storm and consequently rebuilt by Richard Wych (13th Bishop of Chichester).
	<p><b>1448</b>: Adam de Moleyns (31st Bishop of Chichester) was awarded a licence to fortify the house from the invading French and enclosed 2,000 acres of Bexhill as a park.</p>
	<p><b>1561</b>: Queen Elizabeth I acquired the manor of Bexhill and in 1570 gave it to Sir Thomas Sackville (1st Baron Buckhurst). Maintained as a farmstead, the house on the hill became known as Court Lodge.</p>
	<p><b>1662</b>: Major parts of Court Lodge were demolished and rebuilt by Sackville’s descendants (Earls later Dukes of Dorset), although they preferred to stay at the much larger Knole House in Sevenoaks, Kent.</p>
	<b>1700s</b>: Court Lodge was mainly used as a hunting lodge by the Sackvilles.

	<b>1800s</b>: Arthur Sawyer Brook (known as ‘Squire’ Brook) and his family acted as bailiffs and stewards of the manor.
	<p><b>1813</b>: Elizabeth Sackville married George Sackville-West (5th Earl De La Warr). In 1864 Elizabeth inherited all the Sackville lands thus bringing together the Sackville and De La Warr estates.</p>
	<p><b>1873</b>: The house would eventually be passed down to Reginald Sackville (7th Earl De La Warr).</p>
	<p><b>1891</b>: Viscount Cantelupe (later 8th Earl De La Warr) married Lady Muriel Agnes Brassey and they moved to Bexhill. The lodge now known as the Manor House was duly refurbished at a cost of £15,000. This included the installation of electricity, telephone and transforming the farm's barn into a pavilion (now known as the Manor Barn) which hosted many aristocratic parties.</p>
	<p><b>1902</b>: The 8th Earl De La Warr’s influence on Bexhill came to an end after financial and personal troubles and a subsequent divorce.</p>
	<p><b>1903</b>: The German painter August Neven du Mont and his family rented the Manor House, making further improvements and extensions. Neven du Mont became terminally ill in 1909 and died soon after at the age of 42.</p>
	<b>1912</b>: Countess De La Warr sold the Manor House to Sir Robert Leicester Harmsworth but his family were usually only there for holidays. Sir Robert died in 1937 and the house stayed in the family until the death of Lady Harmsworth in 1963.

	<b>1966</b>: With no beneficiaries to the estate, Bexhill Corporation (forerunner of Rother District Council) bought and tried to sell the property without success. This led to the formation of Bexhill Old Town Preservation Society.
	<p><b>1968</b>: The council demolished the Manor House to widen De La Warr Road. The Preservation Society prevented the land from being used for high-rise flats and a public garden was created which retains some ruins of the Manor House and most of the ancillary buildings.</p>

	Today the ruins of the former manor house can be explored inside Manor Gardens. Some medieval features can still be seen such as the cobbled stone walls, doorways, windows and a relatively recent 1930's fireplace.
