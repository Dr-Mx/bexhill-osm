	<b>1250</b>: It is thought that the an original wooden building (called Bishops Palace) was damaged by the great storm and consequently rebuilt by Richard Wych (13th Bishop of Chichester).
	<p><b>1448</b>: Adam de Moleyns (31st Bishop of Chichester) was awarded a licence to fortify the building from the invading French and enclosed 2,000 acres of Bexhill as a park.</p>
	<p><b>1535</b>: Along with the confiscation of other church lands, Henry VIII decrees that the Manor of Bexhill is attached to the Crown.</p>
	<p><b>1590</b>: Queen Elizabeth I grants the manor to Lord High Treasurer - Thomas Sackville. The manor then became known as Court Lodge.<sup>1</sup></p>
	<p><b>1608</b>: Robert, 2nd Earl of Dorset and son of Thomas Sackville, inherits Bexhill Manor.</p>
	<p><b>C17</b>: Major parts of Court Lodge are rebuilt.</p>
	<p><b>C18</b>: The manor is used as a shooting lodge for the Dukes of Dorset and their entourage.</p>
	<p><b>C19</b>: Court Lodge is occupied by a number of families including the Brook family, who act as bailiffs of the manor.</p>
	<p><b>1892</b>: Court Lodge became the first home in Bexhill to have a telephone, after the 8th Earl De La Warr fully renovated and expanded the house. This included transforming the farm's barn into a pavilion (now known as the Manor Barn) and hosted many aristocratic parties.</p>
	<p><b>1898</b>: The 8th Earl De La Warr backed a venture headed by entrepreneur Ernest Terah Hooley which fell apart, destroying much of the family fortune and thus ended their influence on Bexhill.</p>
	<p><b>1903</b>: The German painter August Neven du Mont and his family bought the manor. Neven du Mont became terminally ill in 1909, and died soon after.</p>
	<b>1912</b>: Sir Robert Leicester Harmsworth (1870 to 1937) and his family took ownership of the manor, although usually only for holidays, until the death of Lady Harmsworth in 1963.

	<b>1963</b>: With no beneficiaries to the estate, Bexhill Corporation (now Rother District Council) bought and tried to sell property with no success. This led to the formation of The Bexhill Old Town Preservation Society.
	<p><b>1968</b>: Unfortunately this was not enough to stop the demolition of the manor to widen De La Warr Road. Although the preservation society did prevent the land from being used for high-rise flats and instead turn it into a public space.</p>

	Today the ruins of the former manor house can be explored inside Manor Gardens. Some medieval features can still be seen such as the cobbled stone walls, doorways, windows and a relatively recent 1930's fireplace.
