	<b>1250</b>: It is thought that the original wooden building built around 1066 (called Bishops Palace) was damaged by the October great storm and consequently rebuilt by Richard Wych (13th Bishop of Chichester).
	<p><b>1448</b>: Adam de Moleyns (31st Bishop of Chichester) was awarded a licence to fortify land from the invading French and enclosed 2,000 acres of Bexhill as a park.</p>
	<p><b>1535</b>: Along with the confiscation of other church lands, Henry VIII decrees that the administrative land known as Manor of Bexhill is attached to the Crown.</p>
	<p><b>1570</b>: Queen Elizabeth I grants the Manor of Bexhill to Thomas Sackville (1st Baron Buckhurst). Still used as a farmstead, the house on the hill became known as Court Lodge.<sup>1</sup></p>
	<p><b>1608</b>: Robert, 2nd Earl of Dorset and son of Thomas Sackville, inherits the farmstead.</p>
	<b>C17</b>: Major parts of Court Lodge are demolished and rebuilt by Sackville’s descendants (Dukes and Earls of Dorset), although they preferred to stay at the much larger Knole House in Sevenoaks, Kent.

	<b>C18</b>: Court Lodge is mainly used as a hunting lodge by the Sackville’s. Arthur Brook and his family act as bailiffs and stewards of the manor.
	<p><b>1873</b>: The lodge would eventually be passed down to Reginald Sackville (7th Earl De La Warr).</p>
	<p><b>1891</b>: Viscount Cantelupe (8th Earl De La Warr) inherits Court Lodge when he marries Lady Muriel Agnes Brassey. Now known as the Manor House, it was was duly refurbished at a cost of £15,000. This included the installation of electricity, telephone and transforming the farm's barn into a pavilion (now known as the Manor Barn) which hosted many aristocratic parties.</p>
	<p><b>1902</b>: The 8th Earl De La Warr’s influence on Bexhill came to an end after an extramarital affair and subsequent divorce.</p>
	<p><b>1903</b>: The German painter August Neven du Mont and his family let the manor, making further improvements and extensions. Neven du Mont became terminally ill in 1909, and died soon after at the age of 42.</p>
	<b>1912</b>: Sir Robert Leicester Harmsworth and his family took ownership of the manor, although usually only for holidays. Sir Hamsworth died in 1937 and the house stayed in the family until the death of Lady Harmsworth in 1963.

	<b>1966</b>: With no beneficiaries to the estate, Bexhill Corporation (now Rother District Council) bought and tried to sell the property with no success. This led to the formation of Bexhill Old Town Preservation Society.
	<p><b>1968</b>: The council demolishes the Manor House to widen De La Warr Road. The preservation society prevents the land from being used for high-rise flats and creates a public garden which retains some “ruins” of the manor house and most of the ancillary buildings.</p>

	Today the ruins of the former manor house can be explored inside Manor Gardens. Some medieval features can still be seen such as the cobbled stone walls, doorways, windows and a relatively recent 1930's fireplace.
