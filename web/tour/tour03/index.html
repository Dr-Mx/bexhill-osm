	<h3>Smuggling (1700-1850)</h3>
	The beaches of East Sussex were largely controlled by highly-organized smuggling gangs during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The black market grew in strength when high levels of taxation were imposed on imported luxuries.
	<p>
	To try and quash this influx of illegal trading, a 'riding officer' was based at Bexhill in 1791.<sup>[<a onclick="window.parent.tourSource(5);">5</a>]</sup> His job was to inquire and report about any smuggled goods along the coast, and if required, arrest and prosecute any felons he found (a tough job as the officer was often outnumbered).

	By 1816 the Royal Navy's Coast Blockade Service had taken over to combat the smuggling, which proved to be a successful deterrent but were considered fair game for bribery.<sup>[<a onclick="window.parent.tourSource(6);">6</a>]</sup>
	<p>
	Those that smuggled were known as landsmen: responsible for arranging distribution on the route to the main market in London. Little Common had one of the best-known smuggling gangs led by George Gillham and his family. Known as the Little Common Gang, they met regularly at the Wheatsheaf Inn (still located on Barnhorn Road) to draw their plans.<sup>[<a onclick="window.parent.tourSource(7);">7</a>]</sup>

	In the early hours of Friday 3rd January 1828 events were reaching their climax. The Coast Blockade manning the Martello Tower on Galley Hill spotted illicit cargo being landed on the beach close to where The Sackville now stands.<br>
	Calling for reinforcements the Blockade caught up to their foes at Sidley Green. In a surprise attack, the smugglers rushed down the hill armed with bats killing the Quartermaster Charles Collins. The Blockade withdrew and regrouped repeatedly throughout the night, slowly forcing the smugglers to retreat into the lanes around the Old Town and farmland beyond.<br>
	By the time it was over dozens were injured from both sides, including another fatality - an old smuggler hacked to death with swords. Eight smugglers were caught but the alleged cargo of six hundred gallons of French liquor was long gone.<br>
	Those sentenced were spared the gallows and transported to Australia.

	In 1831 Her Majesty's Coastguard replaced the naval forces of the Coast Blockade. Cottages for living quarters and watch-rooms and store-rooms were erected in 1832 providing a permanent defence against smuggling.
