	<h3>Prehistory</h3>
	Bexhill was not always a coastal town, 130 million years ago it was fresh-water flood plain composed of silt, clay and sandstone - perfect conditions for preserving imprints of prehistoric life.

	Resulting from storms and erosion from the sea, the cliffs around Galley Hill can often yield a surprising range of fossils. Dinosaur remains, crocodiles, sharks, lizards, turtles and various fish have been found.<sup>1</sup>
	<p>The best time to find fossils is during the spring low tides where dinosaur footprints become visible, including tracks from an Iguanodon - a three and half ton, ten meter long herbivore. Click the map-icon above to see where you can find these for yourself.</p>

	<p>Jamie Hiscocks found the world's first fossilised dinosaur brain in a rock pool on the beach in 2004. It appears to show part of a brain cavity and tissue belonging to a relative of a Iguanodon.</p>
	Preserved in the swampy vegetated environment, the dinosaur's brain was essentially pickled. The specimen doesn't give a clear indicator of the original size, but does resemble those of modern birds and crocodiles.

	A cervical vertebra from the world's smallest dinosaur; a foot-long, 7oz Maniraptoran was uncovered by Dave Brockhurst at the site of Ashdown Brickworks on Turkey Road in 2011.

	<p>A vast selection of local dinosaur fossils can be found on display within Bexhill Museum.</p>

	The highest points in Bexhill are St. Peters Church in the Old Town, and Mill Wood in the Highlands (right-click anywhere on the map to see an elevation level).
	<p><span class="comment">The sub-soil is of Wadhurst clay, with patches of Tunbridge Wells sand of various size and thickness, on one of which the Old Town stands. Underlying this are beds of sandstone and Ashdown sand. There is a narrow strip of Ashdown sand along the shore extending from Bulverhythe on the east to near Cooden on the west.
	The widest part of this is near the West Station, where it extends a little north of Beeching Road. It is interrupted at the eastern end by a small patch of Fairlight clay. On the north-east, at Buckholt, there is an outcrop of Ashdown sand at the head of a small valley of alluvium, through which the Combe Haven river finds its way to the sea.
	North of Normans Bay there is marshy land, consisting of alluvium, with two or three patches of blown sand and Wadhurst clay. The shore is of sand and sandstone, with beds of lignite from 2 feet to 6 inches in thickness.</span><sup>2</sup></p>
