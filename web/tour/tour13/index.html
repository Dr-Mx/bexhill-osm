	<p class="maplink" title="Show on map" onclick="window.parent.tourFocus('lost', 'Wshelt');"><strong>West Parade Shelters</strong></p>
	West Parade, 1903-1977.	Located opposite the Clock Tower, this once elegant Edwardian structure was a functioning bandstand then a sole shelter from about 1920.<br>
	Both these shelters were demolished in 1977 due to lack of upkeep. Today on West Parade we have four controversial shelters built in 2011 by Duggan Morris Architects.

	<p class="maplink" title="Show on map" onclick="window.parent.tourFocus('lost', 'Metrop');"><strong>Metropole Hotel</strong></p>
	West Parade, 1897-1955. Architect Joseph Wall, opened in May 1900. 160 bedrooms, smoking-room, billard-room, tennis courts and electric lifts.<br>
	In May 1940 a serious fire broke out when the RAF was occupying the building. Four months later it was bombed by the Germans, and left derelict until its demolition in 1957.<br>
	The only remains are a length of wall next to the De La Warr Pavilion stage entrance, and its 4 acres of private gardens - now the public Metropole Lawns.

	<p class="maplink" title="Show on map" onclick="window.parent.tourFocus('lost', 'Fount1');"><strong>Memorial Fountain</strong></p>
	1913-1963. Following the death of the Nripendra Narayan Maharaja of Cooch Behar on 18th September 1911, a memorial fountain was subsequently erected by the Coastguard Cottages behind the Colonnade.<sup>[<a onclick="window.parent.tourSource(19);">19</a>]</sup><br>
	It was later moved in 1934 to the southern sloped entrance to Egerton Park when the De La Warr Pavilion began construction. It was again moved in 1963 to Bexhill Cemetery for restoration, soon afterwards the fountain seems to have been removed from this site - its fate is currently unknown.

	Sea Road, 1902-2003. Opened its doors for guests in 1905 and closed in 1966. Reopened as The Grand Hotel until it's final closure in 2000.<br>
	Once a symbol of Bexhill's edwardian era - sporting 70 elegant bedrooms, a restaurant and a number of function rooms - the Grade II listed building was a victim of arson and demolished shortly after leaving the area as brownfield for over a decade.<br>
