	<h3>World War II (1939-45)</h3>
	Initially Bexhill was identified as a safe place at the outbreak of the Second World War and received over 700 evacuated children from London. This changed in early 1940 when frequent air-raids began along the south coast.
	<h3 class="maplink" title="Show on map" onclick="window.parent.tour('ww2Bombmap');">Incident Locations</h3>
	There were 63 air-raids in total, dropping around 450 high-explosive bombs and over 1,000 incendiary bombs. 81 buildings were destroyed, 217 seriously damaged and 4,324 lightly damaged. 21 civilian deaths were recorded, 1 soldier lost his life.<sup>14</sup>
	<p>For almost 80 days Bexhill lay in the 'bomb alley' flight path to London, in one 24 hour period over 48 V-1 flying bombs (doodlebugs) were tracked overhead.<br>

	The bomb locations are taken from a 1944 Bexhill Observer map made by former local estate agent Percy Webber<sup>15</sup>, with present-day context given by David Hatherell from the Local History Study Group.
	<h3 class="maplink" title="Show on map" onclick="window.parent.tour('ww2Shelters');">Air-raid Shelters</h3>
	Also known as bomb shelters, these were structures used by civilians in the event of enemy attacks from the air. There were 70 of these in use around the town.
	<p>In the 1943 equipment census, it was reported that the store of Crawford chocolate wholemeal biscuits had been stolen from all of Bexhill's public shelters!</p>

	<h3 class="maplink" title="Show on map" onclick="window.parent.tour('ww2Structures');">Existing Structures Today</h3>
	Bexhill's beaches were closed off and surrounded by barbed wire, mines and concrete anti-tank cubes. Light anti-aircraft guns supported by armoured vehicles were placed around town and later, heavy anti-aircraft guns were installed along the promenade.
	<p>Anti-tank cubes (dragons's teeth), air raid shelters and pillboxes can still be found today. There are also three war memorials.</p>
