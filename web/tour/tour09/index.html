	<h3>World War II (1939-45)</h3>
	Initially Bexhill was identified as a safe place at the outbreak of the Second World War and received over 700 evacuated children from London.  This changed in 1940 when frequent air-raids began along the south coast.

	There were 51 air-raids in total, dropping 328 explosive bombs and over 1,000 incendiary bombs. 81 buildings were destroyed, 217 seriously damaged and 4,324 lightly damaged. 25 deaths were recorded, including 1 soldier.<sup>[<a onclick="window.parent.tourSource(14);">14</a>]</sup>
	<p>
	For almost 80 days Bexhill lay in the 'bomb alley' flight path to London, in one 24 hour period over 480 doodlebugs (V-1 flying bombs) were tracked overhead.

	Bexhill's beaches were closed off and surrounded by barbed wire, mines and concrete anti-tank cubes.  Light anti-aircraft guns supported by armoured vehicles were placed around town and later, heavy anti-aircraft guns were installed along the promenade.

	A few anti-tank cubes (dragons's teeth), air raid shelters and pillboxes can still be found today.  There are also three war memorials.
