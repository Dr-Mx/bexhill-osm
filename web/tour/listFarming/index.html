	The old Bexhill parish contained just under 8,000 acres and the main industry was farming, as with most rural areas. This is a vast subject and much information is available at the East Sussex Record Office in Lewes. We do get a good view of the situation from looking at the Tithe Map of 1839, so we will take a look at the middle 19th century.
	<p>There were a great many farms, some were large, covering many acres, especially on the far west side of the parish where the land is mainly marsh, and others were very small containing no more than 5 or 6 acres.</p>
	These farms were mainly mixed, others such as Pebsham and Glyne Manor were known for their dairy herds.
	<p>Hops were also grown, but on a very small scale. Out of the 8,000 acres there were only 67 acres of hops. Most of the oast houses have now gone, but one or two remain, either converted into dwellings or derelict.</p>

	Originally, Tithes, (meaning tenths) were paid in kind (crops, milk etc.), comprising a tenth of the yearly produce from farming and cultivation, and made by parishioners for the support of their parish church and its clergy. By 1836 the government had decided to substitute money payments for payments in kind.
	<p>Each parish had a map drawn covering the whole parish and showing all fields, woods, waterways and buildings. This map was sometimes coloured; the buildings coloured red were residential and the ones coloured grey were non-residential, such as farm buildings, stables etc. each plot had a number.</p>
	A schedule or apportionment went with this map listing the following information against each plot number.<sup>1</sup> It was listed alphabetically in landowner order and not numerically in plot number order.
	<p>Landowner, Occupier, Plot Number, Description (i.e. whether a cottage and garden or if a field, the field name); Type of cultivation, acreage and Tithe payable.</p>
	These maps and schedules give the local and family historian valuable information on the layout of the parishes and the people who lived and worked there at that time.
	<p>The Tithe Map for the Bexhill parish was drawn by John Adams of Hawkhurst in 1839 and the Tithe Schedule was made in 1843.</p>
