		<h3 class="maplink" title="Show on map" onclick="window.parent.tour('baird');">John Logie Baird</h3>
		<img class="float-left" alt="John Logie Baird" src="img/baird.jpg">
		<p>1888-1946. Born in Scotland and studied at Glasgow University until the outbreak of the First World War, where he worked as a electrical engineer in munitions work.</p>
		<p>Although many inventors worked on the development of television, in 1925 Baird was credited as the first to produce a moving television image.</p>
		<p>Baird's other developments include a thermal undersock, fibre-optics, infrared night vision and radar - the latter still somewhat conjecture as it is still 'classified information'.</p>
		In 1944 he moved to Bexhill and lived at 1 Station Road. The house was demolished in 2007 and the site is now apartments named Baird Court.

		<h3 class="maplink" title="Show on map" onclick="window.parent.tour('milligan');">Spike Milligan</h3>
		<img class="float-left" alt="Spike Milligan" src="img/milligan.jpg">
		<p>1918-2002. The Milligan family came to England from India where Spike's father was serving as a gunner in the army. Prior to the Second World War Spike played the trumpet in a jazz band.</p>
		<p>On the 2nd June 1940 Milligan was posted to D Battery 56th Heavy Regiment Royal Artillery located at 'Worthingholm', Bexhill-on-Sea. This was part of an evacuated girls school on Hastings Road<sup>3</sup>, located where Charter Towers apartments are today.</p>
		<p>As part of his duties, Spike manned one of the artillery observation posts on Galley Hill (contrary to popular belief this was not the pillbox standing today). He left the town on the 6th January 1943.</p>
		<p>Milligan broke into the world of radio broadcasting in 1951 with The Goon Show, one episode being of special local interest - The Dreaded Batter Pudding Hurler (of Bexhill-on-Sea).</p>
		A cast-iron 'Portrait Bench' sculpture of Milligan can be found on the beach at Glyne Gap.

		<p>The Maharajah came to Bexhill to convalesce after leaving Moor Hall, Ninfield. He died at 22 Marine Court Avenue on the 18th September 1911.</p>
