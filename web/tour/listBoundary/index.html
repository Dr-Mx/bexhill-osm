	In September 1859 a local builder, Robert Burchell, signed a contract with the Corporation of Hastings to supply 60 stones to mark the boundaries of the Borough of Hastings and the Liberty of the Sluice at Pevensey.
	<p>At a total cost of 33 pounds 15 shillings (about £2,000 today), they were made of York stone and had the letters <i>CH</i> cut in them.<sup>1</sup> 27 stones were delivered to Pevensey and had numbers cut in them, the stones for the home boundary had letters from A-P.</p>
	<p>After the incorporation of Bexhill Borough, it was decided in 1909 that another set of 63 large stones should be placed along the 12 mile perimeter of Bexhill. Starting from Normans Bay, up through Lunsford's Cross, along to Watermill Lane, down through Combe Valley, finishing at Glyne Gap.</p>
	<p>Made of Cornish granite, at a cost of 15 shilling each (about £3,700 in total today), these were all sequentially numbered and prefixed with <i>BB</i>.<sup>2</sup></p>
	A number of these stones have disappeared over the years, either through boundary adjustments, development, bank erosion or general neglect. In a recent survey only 31 of the Bexhill stones have been found - one in Hastings Museum (BB46).

	<h3>Beating the Bounds</h3>
	An ancient tradition, started when there were few maps and it was necessary for representatives of a parish to walk the boundaries of their area to establish that there had been no encroachments. At suitable points, people were 'bumped' in order to instil into their memories the actual boundary.
	<p>Bexhill councillors have carried out the ceremony on the 7th October 1909 (to scout out where BB stones were to be placed), 20th June 1925, 17th July 1928 and 6th May 2002 (more of a photo opportunity at Glyne Gap).</p>
