	The name Bexhill was originally Bixlea from the 8th century, then followed by the Doomsday Book's Bexlei meaning 'glade where box trees grow'. It is thought that a misunderstanding in language during the 13th century turned the second syllable into 'hill'.<sup>[<a onclick="window.parent.tourSource(1);">1</a>]</sup>
