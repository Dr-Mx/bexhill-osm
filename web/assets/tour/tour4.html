	<h3>Railways (1846+)</h3>
	
	<b>Bexhill Railway Station</b><p class="maplink" title="Show on map" onclick="window.parent.tour('railwayBexhillstation');"></p>
	There have been three separate stations here since 1846; one was located where Sainsbury's carpark is now, the second was on Devonshire Square, and in 1902 they amalgamated to form the station we now have on Sea Road.<sup>[<a onclick="window.parent.tour('source');">7</a>]</sup><br>
	The long platforms were a benefit to the huge amount of visitors and private schools that operated in the 1900's.  There would be so many travelling at the weekends, it would often be preferable to catch the early morning milk train down from London.<br>
	In 2008 the station went under heavy restoration and is now a Grade II listed building.

	<b>Bexhill West Branch Line</b><p class="maplink" title="Display overlay" onclick="window.parent.tour('railwayWestbranch');"></p>
	Running from 1902 to 1964 this railway was a branch of the Hastings Line.  It ran from Crowhurst to what is now known as the Beeching Road Industrial Estate in Sidley.<br>
	The largest structure on the line was the Combe Haven Viaduct.  It took two years and nine million bricks to build the seventeen arches over the marshland.  It was destroyed in 1969 by controlled demolition - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1ZPdUqb37c" target="_blank">video</a>.

	<b>Bexhill West Station</b><p class="maplink" title="Show on map" onclick="window.parent.tour('railwayWeststation');"></p>
	The terminating point for the West Branch Line, hence the named location of Terminus Road.  The main building surives, now as an auction gallery and pub.  Across the road where Belmont apartments are today was once the bus depot.

	<b>Sidley Station</b><p class="maplink" title="Show on map" onclick="window.parent.tour('railwaySidleystation');"></p>
	Part of the West Branch Line, Sidley Station was located where Elva Way and the BP Service Station stands today.<br>
	Two hotels were built to accommodate visitors; The Sussex Hotel (today known as Sussex House), and the Pelham Hotel (now The Pelham).

	<b>Glyne Gap Halt Railway Station</b><p class="maplink" title="Show on map" onclick="window.parent.tour('railwayGlynegap');"></p>
	Built in 1905 between stations Bexhill and Hastings, closed ten years later due to competition from the electric tramway.  Currently there is a study to see if it is viable to have the station reinstated.
