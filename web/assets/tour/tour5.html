	<h3>Tramway &amp; Trolleybuses (1906-59)</h3><p class="maplink" title="Display overlay" onclick="window.parent.tour('tramway');"></p>
	Hastings Tramways Company was founded in early 1904 and public services started in 1906.  The length of the tramline was just shy of 20 miles, running from West Marina in St. Leonards to Cooden Beach.
	<p>
	The electric trams originally used a ground level power supply, then later changed (due to safety reasons) to petrol powered dynamos, and finally to over-head wires.<sup>[<a onclick="window.parent.tour('source');">8</a>]</sup>
	<p>
	The tramlines were removed in 1928 to make way for trolleybuses which were in use until 1959.
